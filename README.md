# GPT2-Review


The goal of this project is to gain a deep intuition for the transformers architecture and brush off any rust I might have had with pytorch.

I am using Neel Nanda's collab template in order to do this. I found this when reading through Neel Nanda's article, steps on getting up to speed with Mechanistic Interpretability: https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started.

Here are the resources I used to reason through this task:
