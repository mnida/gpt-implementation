# paper-implementation


The goal of this project is to gain a deep intuition for the transformers architecture and brush off any rust I might have had with pytorch.

I was inspired by Neel Nanda's article, steps on getting up to speed with Mechanistic Interpretability https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started.
